Version 2.7
=======================
IMPORTANT: with the update to version 2.7 the internal database will be deleted due to
           internal changes. You only need to re-import (update data sources) your movies
           and TV shows

With the update to 2.7 there are massive changes under the hood of tinyMediaManager:
- moved source code management to GitHub and changed the build system to maven
- changed the internal database engine from ObjectDB to H2-MVStore + JSON
  this change makes tinyMediaManager more robust and faster
- introduced a new infrastructure for scrapers which makes developing new 
  scrapers less complex and opens the scraper interface to other developers

+ rewrote all scrapers from scratch (including optimizations and bug fixes)
+ added a very special scraper for all that who have Kodi installed ;) (donator only)
+ assign movie sets feature is now free for all (dropped donator only status)
+ added automatic trailer download at scrape (dropped donator only status for trailer download)
+ added "date added" to the columns of the movie list
+ enhanced UI language to enable country specific translations (e.g. pt_BR)
+ changed trakt.tv login mode to PIN auth (you may re-check your settings)
+ added media info editor (some fields from media info are now maintain able)
+ added title sortable to TV shows section
+ added displayepisode and displayseason for TV shows
+ added option to persist UI filter settings
+ added native file- and directory-open dialogs
+ updated mediainfo to 0.7.78 and generalized folder structure
+ added <streamdetails> tag for episodes
+ refactored episode chooser (search for episode is now available)
+ take the date added from the video file where possible
