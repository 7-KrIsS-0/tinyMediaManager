Version 2.7
=======================
IMPORTANT: with tinyMediaManager version 2.7 we do not support Java6 anymore.
           If you are still using Java6, please update or you will stay at version 2.6.x
IMPORTANT: with the update to version 2.7 the internal database will be deleted due to
           internal changes. You only need to re-import (update data sources) your movies
           and TV shows

With the update to 2.7 there massive changes under the hood of tinyMediaManager:            
- moved source code management to github and changed build to maven            
- changed the internal database engine from objectdb to H2-MVStore + JSON
  this change makes tinyMediaManager more robust and faster
- introduced a new infrastructure for scrapers which makes developing new 
  scrapers less complex

+ rewrote all scrapers from scratch (including optimizations and bug fixes)
+ assign movie sets feature is now free for all (dropped donator only status)
+ added "date added" to the columns of the movie list
+ enhanced UI language to enable country specific translations (e.g. pt_BR)
x changed NFO rewriting behavior to be less aggressive
x prevent setting incomplete meta data when scraping was not successful
x adding special characters to the sort title prefixes is now possible
x several fixes in the movie renamer               
x reworked internal representation of artwork file names/url 
  (performace boost for movie sets)
